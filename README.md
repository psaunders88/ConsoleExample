# ConsoleExample
Just playing with the symfony2 console component without the full framework. Also making a effort to take testing more seriously

I appriciate that this isn't very useful. It's really more of a personal devlopement exercise 

# Usage
php application.php math 0 + 1 2 3 4

Output: 10

php application.php math 10 / 5 2

Output: 1

#todo
1. Write tests for MathCommand (I know I should have tested first)
2. Write tests for MathManager (See above)
